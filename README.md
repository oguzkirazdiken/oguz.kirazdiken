# My Portfolio

Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic and self learning purposes.

Here you can find my [resume](https://github.com/oguzkirazdiken/msc-files/blob/master/oguz%20kirazdiken%20resume.pdf).


[Prediction of Hotel Reservation Cancellations](https://oguzkirazdiken.github.io/oguz.kirazdiken/Capstone%20Project%20Report%20_Prediction%20of%20Hotel%20Reservation%20Cancellations.pdf): This study aims to create a model to predict the reservation requests that may be potentially cancelled using the information related to reservation requests. For this purpose, the reservation request gathered by hotels in Portugal for a period of two years are examined. Machine learning algorithms such as random forest, decision trees, logistic regression, gradient boosting classifier and extra gradient boosting classifier are trained and tested on the above-mentioned real data and the results are discussed in detail. Here you can find the project's [codebook](https://oguzkirazdiken.github.io/oguz.kirazdiken/Hotel%20Booking%20Demand%20Prediction.html).

[Predicting House Sales Price in King County, USA](https://oguzkirazdiken.github.io/oguz.kirazdiken/Project%20MA%E2%80%93Tamirane.html): Developed a model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market with using various libraries in R. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house with using Geolocational Clustering.

[Predicting Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset](https://oguzkirazdiken.github.io/oguz.kirazdiken/Breast%20Cancer%20Wisconsin%20(Diagnostic)%20Data%20Set%20Term%20Project.html): The notebook includes explonatory analyis, simple classification model building and hyperparameter tuning studies with Winsconsin dataset.The dataset describes 30 different characteristics of breast mass which are calculated in 3-dimentional space.
